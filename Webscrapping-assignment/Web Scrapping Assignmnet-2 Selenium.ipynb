       "18        It’s been almost a month since I have been using this phone. I upgraded from an iPhone 8. The main issue with my 8 was battery and this phone is just awesome when it comes to battery. It lasts a day and a half for me with my regular use , internet connected always with 4gCan’t move forward without saying this. Battery of this phone is a life saver when I am traveling or at work when I don’t get the option to chargeCamera is superb. Front cam selfies and back cam photos are just awesome....  \n",

It’s worth at this price. I will highly recommend it if you want to move to iOS. The best part of this phone is it’s camera and it’s battery life. This two things have won my heart. I loved it.

It's pleasure to use iOS and the quality product by Apple. Iphone 11 still works like a beast in 2021 also. It really capable of doing day to day usage as well as hard core gaming. Battery is awesome. I'm really too much satisfied with it. Apart fto the very gorgious IPS LCD (AMOLED will be better) everything is mind boggling. Iphone💕.  \n",

       "48                                               Well while switching from android to iOS the first thing you need to be careful about is that you will loose all your whatsapp chat backups as both are different operating systems. Camera clarity is awesome and though being an lcd screen clarity and resolution is good. Battery backup is also good unlike previous gen iPhone. So far the experience is good will Padre after a few months of usage.P.S the black is more of a dark grey shade and not jet black  \n",

Battery backup is good especially when you play games like Pubg COD. But it is sort of heavy when you hold in hands. Portrait mode is best to click pictures. Stage light effect is awesome. Try to click photos outside in nature because photos inside home or room will not give you the quality in any phone even in DSLR.  \n",
